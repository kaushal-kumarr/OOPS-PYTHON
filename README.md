 OOPs Python Practice – Real World Examples

This repository contains my personal practice of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python. Each folder represents a major pillar of OOP, and includes real-world problems and examples for better understanding and application.

TOPICS COVERED

1.  Abstraction
Implemented using abstract base classes (`ABC`) to hide unnecessary implementation details and expose only essential interfaces.

2.  Encapsulation
Showcased through private variables and getter/setter methods to protect data inside classes.

3.  Class & Object
Basic structure of OOP – creation of reusable class templates and multiple objects.

Demonstrated **single**, **multilevel**, and **multiple inheritance** **hierarchical** with practical examples like employee management, vehicle systems, etc.

5. Polymorphism
Explored **method overriding**  using real-world use cases:
